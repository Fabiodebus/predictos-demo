# Email Campaign Demo - Project Plan & Status

## üéØ **Project Goal**
Create a simple frontend demo that showcases an AI-powered email campaign generation workflow using Exa API for company research and Letta Cloud for personalized email generation.

## üîÑ **Intended Workflow**
1. **User Input Form:**
   - Lead LinkedIn URL
   - Company domain
   - Search query for research
   - Campaign settings (emails count, threads, language, formality)

2. **Research Phase (Exa API):**
   - Search for company information based on query
   - Display research results with highlights and sources
   - Show what data will be sent to the agent

3. **AI Generation Phase (Letta Agent):**
   - Send research + campaign settings to sophisticated German B2B copywriting agent
   - **Show agent reasoning and thought process in real-time**
   - Display how the agent analyzes the research and builds the email

4. **Final Output:**
   - Display generated personalized email
   - Show copy/download options
   - **Demo only** - no actual sending

## üìä **Current Implementation Status**

### ‚úÖ **Fully Completed:**
- Next.js application with TypeScript & Tailwind CSS
- Professional UI components inspired by 21st.dev
- **Exa API Research Integration:** Working with comprehensive company research
- **Research Results Display:** Collapsible sections, formatted content, manual user control
- **UI/UX Flow:** Manual progression with "Generate Email Campaign" button
- **Loading States:** Theme-aware backgrounds and simplified loading screens
- Environment configuration with working API keys

### üîß **Partially Completed:**
- **Letta Cloud Integration:** API format fixed, streaming implemented, but agent access issue
- **Enhanced Debugging:** Comprehensive logging and error handling added

### ‚ùå **Current Issue:**
- **Letta Agent Communication:** Getting 400 "Invalid request body" error
- **Root Cause:** Agent `agent-b78b5849-2940-4c38-92f9-275f2aeb1e7e` may not exist in project `copywriting-demo`
- **Status:** Agent accessibility verification needed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **API Configuration:**
- **Exa API Key:** `863c0679-a0c3-4ae7-9b8b-e2bad22780eb` ‚úÖ Working
- **Letta API Key:** `sk-let-OWRmM...` ‚úÖ Working  
- **Letta Agent:** `agent-b78b5849-2940-4c38-92f9-275f2aeb1e7e` ‚ö†Ô∏è Access Issue
- **Letta Project:** `copywriting-demo` ‚ö†Ô∏è Agent may not exist in this project
- **Dev Server:** Running on http://localhost:3000 ‚úÖ Working

## üõ†Ô∏è **Implementation Progress**

### **Step 1: Exa API Research** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Create isolated test endpoint for Exa API
- [x] Test with sample company domain and query
- [x] Verify data structure and response format
- [x] Handle errors and rate limits
- [x] **Integrated into main workflow with comprehensive research display**

### **Step 2: Frontend UI/UX** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** 
- [x] Welcome screen with PREDIC OS branding
- [x] Multi-step form for campaign configuration
- [x] Research results display with collapsible sections
- [x] Manual user control with "Generate Email Campaign" button
- [x] Theme-aware loading states
- [x] Error handling and user feedback

### **Step 3: Letta Agent Integration** üîß **IN PROGRESS**
- [x] Implement streaming API endpoint `/v1/agents/:id/messages/stream`
- [x] Fix request format (headers, body structure, SSE parsing)
- [x] Add proper message type handling (`reasoning_message`, `assistant_message`)
- [x] Enable live typing with `stream_tokens: true`
- [x] Add keepalive with `include_pings: true`
- [ ] **BLOCKED:** Resolve agent access issue - agent may not exist in `copywriting-demo` project
- [ ] Test complete agent workflow
- [ ] Display reasoning and email generation results

### **Step 4: Data Flow Integration** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Form submission ‚Üí Exa research ‚Üí Memory update ‚Üí Agent processing
- [x] Research data flows correctly to Letta agent memory
- [x] Proper error handling and loading states
- [x] User-controlled workflow progression

### **Step 5: Final Polish** ‚è≥ **PENDING**
- [ ] Complete agent integration (blocked by access issue)
- [ ] Add copy/download functionality for generated emails
- [ ] Test complete end-to-end workflow
- [ ] Handle edge cases and error scenarios

## üé® **Key Requirements**
- **Clean, professional UI** (inspired by 21st.dev)
- **Step-by-step process page** after form submission:
  1. **Research Phase:** Show Exa API results with user's search query
  2. **Copywriting Phase:** Show every Letta tool call and thought process
  3. **Email Preview:** Gmail-like interface with subject line preview, expandable full email
- **Language Support:** German and English (user selects in frontend)
- **Complete Transparency:** Show every tool call and reasoning step
- **Demo-focused** - educational, not production sending
- **User-driven research:** Use exact search query user provides

---

## üìù **Notes & Decisions**
- Using project slug "copywriting-demo" instead of project name
- Agent includes sophisticated German B2B copywriting manual
- Focus on transparency - show each step of the AI process
- Keep as demo - no actual email sending functionality

## üîç **Session Summary (2025-08-28)**

### **Major Accomplishments:**
1. **Research Display:** Implemented collapsible sections, removed verbose queries, fixed formatting
2. **UI Flow:** Added manual user control with "Generate Email Campaign" button
3. **Letta API:** Fixed streaming implementation, proper SSE parsing, correct message types
4. **Debugging:** Added comprehensive error logging and request debugging

### **Current Blocker:**
- **Agent Access Issue:** `400 Invalid request body` despite perfect JSON format
- **Suspected Cause:** Agent `agent-b78b5849-2940-4c38-92f9-275f2aeb1e7e` may not exist in project `copywriting-demo`

### **Created Tools:**
- `/api/test-agent-access` - endpoint to verify agent accessibility
- Enhanced debugging in main workflow

## üöÄ **Next Action**
**PRIORITY:** Resolve agent accessibility issue by testing agent access endpoint and verifying correct agent/project configuration.

**Current Request (Perfect Format):**
```json
URL: https://api.letta.com/v1/agents/agent-b78b5849-2940-4c38-92f9-275f2aeb1e7e/messages/stream
